# Enable newer Vulkan API. Disable if compatibility/performance issue. May
# improve performance when running complex shaders.
# gpu-api=vulkan

# Enable the debanding algorithm. This greatly reduces the amount of visible
# banding, blocking and other quantization artifacts, at the expense of very
# slightly blurring some of the finest details. In practice, it's virtually
# always an improvement - the only reason to disable it would be for
# performance. By default 1:64:16:48.
deband=yes

# The number of debanding steps to perform per sample. Each step reduces a bit
# more banding, but takes time to compute. Note that the strength of each step
# falls off very quickly, so high numbers (>4) are practically useless.
deband-iterations=2

# The debanding filter's cut-off threshold. Higher numbers increase the
# debanding strength dramatically but progressively diminish image details.
deband-threshold=35

# The debanding filter's initial radius. The radius increases linearly for each
# iteration. A higher radius will find more gradients, but a lower radius will
# smooth more aggressively.
deband-range=20

# Add some extra noise to the image. This significantly helps cover up remaining
# quantization artifacts. Higher numbers add more noise.
deband-grain=5

# Dither target depth. If output bit depth cannot be detected, 8 bits per
# component are assumed.

# Resample audio to match the video. This mode will also try to adjust audio
# speed to compensate for other drift. (This means it will play the audio at a
# different speed every once in a while to reduce the A/V difference.)
video-sync=display-resample

# Reduce stuttering caused by mismatches in the video fps and display refresh
# rate (also known as judder). This requires setting the --video-sync option to
# one of the display- modes, or it will be silently disabled. This essentially
# attempts to interpolate the missing frames by convoluting the video along the
# temporal axis. The filter used can be controlled using the --tscale setting.
interpolation

# The filter used for interpolating the temporal axis (frames). This is only
# used if --interpolation is enabled. The only valid choices for --tscale are
# separable convolution filters (use --tscale=help to get a list). The default
# is mitchell. Common --tscale choices include oversample, linear, catmull_rom,
# mitchell, gaussian, or bicubic. These are listed in increasing order of
# smoothness/blurriness, with bicubic being the smoothest/blurriest and
# oversample being the sharpest/least smooth.

# Display English subtitles if available.
slang='eng,en,pl,pol'

# Try harder to show embedded soft subtitles when seeking somewhere. Normally,
# it can happen that the subtitle at the seek target is not shown due to how
# some container file formats are designed. The subtitles appear only if seeking
# before or exactly to the position a subtitle first appears. To make this
# worse, subtitles are often timed to appear a very small amount before the
# associated video frame, so that seeking to the video frame typically does not
# demux the subtitle at that position. Enabling this option makes the demuxer
# start reading data a bit before the seek target, so that subtitles appear
# correctly. Note that this makes seeking slower, and is not guaranteed to
# always work. It only works if the subtitle is close enough to the seek target.
demuxer-mkv-subtitle-preroll=yes

# Resume playback when skip to next file.
reset-on-next-file=pause

# Do not terminate when playing or seeking beyond the end of the file, and there
# is not next file to be played (and --loop is not used). Instead, pause the
# player. When trying to seek beyond end of the file, the player will attempt to
# seek to the last frame.
keep-open=yes

# Always save the current playback position on quit. When this file is played
# again later, the player will seek to the old playback position on start. This
# does not happen if playback of a file is stopped in any other way than
# quitting. For example, going to the next file in the playlist will not save
# the position, and start playback at beginning the next time the file is
# played. This behaviour is disabled by default, but is always available when
# quitting the player with Shift+Q.
